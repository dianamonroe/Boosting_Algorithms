### Predicting diabetes


This dataset originally comes from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The goal is to predict, based on diagnostic measures, whether or not a patient has diabetes.

#### Step 1: Loading the dataset

Loaded the processed dataset from the previous project (split into training and test samples and analyzed with EDA).

#### Step 2: Build a boosting

One way to optimize and improve the results is to generate a boosting so that there is the necessary variety to enrich the prediction. I trained it and analyzed its results. I modified the hyperparameters that define the model with different values and analyzed their impact on the final accuracy and plot the conclusions.

#### Step 3 Analyzis and comparsion of model results

Compared this model vs the previous ones (Regularized Regression and Decision Tree models), analyzed their predictions, the class with the highest prediction accuracy and the one with the lowest. Which of the three models do you choose?
